# Slack Msg Link Replacer Chrome Extension

When copying links to slack messages, the copied URL is structured this way: slack.com/archives/some_msg_id.
This extension will replace the word "archives" to "messages".

When you click on the link with "archives" it opens a new tab that asks me if I want to open the link in the Slack desktop app. ![image](https://github.com/whiteSkar/slack_msg_link_replacer/assets/2031517/3ebd5db3-1690-4d41-bf2d-c5a1ed7d9660)

It's freaking annoying to always having to tap on the link that says "open this link in your browser" to stay in the browser.

Using the URL with "messages" will directly open the link in the browser, making our life so much better.

Having this extension will automatically replace the slack.com/archives/some_msg_id to slack.com/messages/some_msg_id in your clipboard when you use the "Copy link" button

That way, when you paste the link (eg. sending the link to someone else, having links to messages in a doc for reference, and etc), you will make the life of the people who are using your links better.

If you copy from other places such as the Slack's message input field

, 

the extension may not replace the text automatically. In that case, press the extension button to have it replace the text for you.
